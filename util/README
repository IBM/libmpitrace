The "readsparse" utility is designed to read the binary sparse-matrix
files that contain information on the communication patterns that
are recorded with libmpitrace.so when the user specifies :

  export TRACE_SEND_PATTERN=yes
  export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libmpitrace.so
  mpirun -np 1024 your.exe

To build the readsparse utility type make.

To use the utility : readsparse send_bytes.sparse.jobid .  This will
print the contents to standard out, so it is best to redirect output
to a file.  The output lists for each rank the number of messages
and bytes sent to every connected destination rank.  The binary input
file contains information from only those MPI calls that have a 
specific destination rank as a call argument, i.e. some form of send
operation.  Collective MPI operations and receives are not included.

When using PROFILE_BY_CALL_STACK=yes, the mpi_profile outputs contain
instruction addresses for a section of the call stack, for the most
expensive MPI calls.  The translate.py utility is a python3 script that
uses GNU addr2line to translate addresses and print the function name,
source file and line number.  Syntax :

  translate.py mpi_profile.jobid.rank >output.txt

One should include -g as an option for compilation and linking, to
ensure that addr2line can properly translate addresses.
